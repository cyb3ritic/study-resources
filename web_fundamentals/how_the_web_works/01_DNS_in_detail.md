## Making a DNS request

- first computer checks its local cache
- if not found, it checks in the recursive domain server (usually provided by the  ISP, but u can also have your own)
- else it checks in the root DNS server(which acts as the DNS backbone of the internet)
    - it's job is to redirect you to correct TLD server
- TLD server holds record for where to find authoritative server(name server)
- Authoritative DNS server stores the DNS records for a particular domain name and where any updates to your domain name.
    - DNS records all come with a TTL (Time To Live) value(represented in seconds).
