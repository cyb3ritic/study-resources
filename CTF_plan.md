## **Advanced CTF Battle Plan**

This battle plan is designed for advanced-level CTF competitions, focusing on efficiency, tactical approaches, and problem-solving strategies across key domains.

### **1\. Initial Triage Plan (First 10-15 Minutes)**

The first few minutes are crucial for setting the pace and maximizing your score.

**Objective:** Identify low-hanging fruit, understand the challenge landscape, and allocate initial efforts efficiently.

**Steps:**

1. **Connect & Setup (2 mins):**
    - Ensure stable internet connection.
    - Open your note-taking app (e.g., Obsidian, CherryTree, OneNote). Create sections for each category.
    - Prepare your VM or primary toolkit environment.
    - Join any official communication channels (Discord, IRC).
2. **Challenge Board Overview (5 mins):**
    - **Quick Scan:** Open the challenge board. Quickly read the names and point values of _all_ available challenges across your target domains. Don't dive deep into any single one yet.
    - **Categorize by Points:** Mentally (or quickly in notes) group challenges:
        - **Low Points (Likely Easy/Warmup):** These are your primary targets for the first pass.
        - **Medium Points (Moderate Difficulty):** Note these for after the initial sweep.
        - **High Points (Likely Hard/Time-Consuming):** Acknowledge them but generally avoid getting sucked in early unless it's a domain you are exceptionally strong in and the description hints at a familiar technique.
    - **Check Solves (If Visible):** If the platform shows the number of solves, prioritize challenges with more solves within the low/medium point categories. This indicates they are indeed more accessible.
    - **Keywords & Hints:** Look for obvious keywords in challenge descriptions that point to specific vulnerabilities or techniques (e.g., "encoding," "overflow," "sanitize," "packet," "image," "login").
3. **First Pass - Low-Hanging Fruit (8 mins):**
    - **Select 2-3 Easiest Challenges:** Based on points, solves, and keywords, pick the 2-3 challenges that seem quickest to solve, ideally across different domains to get a feel for the CTF style.
    - **Rapid Attack:** Apply the most common, quickest checks for these.
        - **Web:** View source, check /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, common directory names (e.g., /.git/, /.env/). Look for obvious injection points in URL parameters.
        - **Crypto:** Identify encoding (Base64, Hex, Caesar). Try common simple ciphers.
        - **Forensics:** file command, strings, exiftool on any provided files.
        - **Misc:** Often involves steganography, unusual encodings, or simple logic puzzles.
    - **Timebox Strictly:** Spend no more than 3-5 minutes _per challenge_ on this initial attempt. If you don't get it, note down your initial thoughts and _move on_. The goal is quick wins and reconnaissance.

**Prioritizing Between Easy/Medium/Hard Challenges:**

- **Easy First (Always):**
  - **Why:** Builds momentum, gets points on the board, clears your head, and sometimes easy challenges unlock hints or parts of harder ones.
  - **How:** Focus on challenges with the lowest point values or those explicitly labeled "warmup" or "easy." If solve counts are available, those with many solves are good candidates.
- **Medium Next (Calculated Approach):**
  - **Why:** These are the bread and butter of a CTF. Good point/time ratio.
  - **How:**
    - Prioritize based on your strengths. If you're a web guru, tackle medium web challenges before medium crypto if crypto is a weaker area.
    - Look at solve counts. A medium challenge with few solves might be miscategorized or require a very specific, less common trick.
    - Read the description carefully. Does it hint at a technique you're comfortable with?
- **Hard Last (Strategic Selection):**
  - **Why:** High risk, high reward. Can consume a lot of time.
  - **How:**
    - **Only if:** You've cleared most easy/mediums, or a hard challenge falls squarely into your niche expertise and the description gives you a strong lead.
    - **Team Play (if applicable):** Often good for collaboration.
    - **Time Check:** Don't start a potentially very hard challenge if there's little time left in the CTF, unless you're confident of a quick breakthrough.
    - **Look for Dependencies:** Sometimes harder challenges build upon information or tools from easier ones.

**General Triage Rules:**

- **Don't Get Stuck:** If you're not making progress on a challenge after a reasonable amount of time (e.g., 15-20 mins for easy, 30-45 for medium), take a break from it, document what you've tried, and switch to another. Tunnel vision is a CTF killer.
- **Read Carefully:** Misinterpreting the challenge description is a common pitfall. Read it multiple times.
- **Note Everything:** What you tried, what worked, what didn't, any interesting observations. This is vital if you return to a challenge later or if it's part of a chain.

### **2\. Domain-Wise Checklists & Tactics**

#### **A. Web Exploitation**

**Initial Steps:**

1. **Reconnaissance:**
    - View HTML source (Ctrl+U or right-click -> View Page Source). Look for comments, hidden fields, JavaScript files, API endpoints.
    - Check robots.txt, sitemap.xml, .well-known/security.txt.
    - Inspect HTTP headers (developer tools -> Network tab). Look for custom headers, cookies, server technologies.
    - Directory/file fuzzing: dirb, gobuster, ffuf.
        - `gobuster dir -u http://&lt;target&gt;/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt,html,js,bak,old`
    - Subdomain enumeration (if applicable).
    - Technology stack identification (Wappalyzer extension, whatweb).
2. **Spider/Crawl:** Use Burp Suite's spider or a manual crawl to map out the application.

  - **Canary:** Leak canary value, or overwrite specific pointers without touching canary.
  - **RELRO (Relocation Read-Only):** Full RELRO makes GOT overwrite harder. Partial RELRO still allows some GOT overwrites.
- **Pwntools (Python library):** Essential for scripting exploits.

```python
from pwn import \*

# p = process('./vuln_binary')

p = remote('target.com', 1337)

# payload = b'A'\*offset + p64(canary) + b'B'\*8 + p64(rop_gadget_addr) ...

# p.sendline(payload)

# p.interactive()
```

### **4\. If-Stuck Protocol (Domain-Specific Troubleshooting)**

When you hit a wall, use this checklist before giving up or spending too much time.

**General "Stuck" Steps (Apply to All Domains):**

1. **Re-read the Prompt CAREFULLY:** Are you missing a subtle hint or constraint? Did you misunderstand the objective?
2. **Check Assumptions:** What assumptions have you made? Are they valid?
3. **Simplify:** Break the problem into the smallest possible pieces. Test each piece.
4. **Enumerate Everything Again:** Did you miss a file, a port, a parameter, a piece of data?
5. **Try Common Encodings/Decodings:** Base64, Hex, URL, ROT13, etc., on any suspicious string.
6. **Google Error Messages or Unique Strings:** Someone might have faced a similar issue.
7. **Look for CTF Tropes/Patterns:** Is this a common CTF-style trick? (e.g., flag in comments, simple XOR, default creds).
8. **Take a Short Break:** Fresh eyes can make a big difference. Work on another challenge.
9. **Explain the Problem to a Rubber Duck (or Teammate):** Articulating it can reveal gaps in your logic.
10. **Check for Off-by-One Errors:** Common in array indexing, length calculations, etc.

**A. Web Exploitation Stuck?**

- **Different Browser/Incognito:** Rule out caching or extension issues.
- **Check All Input Vectors:** GET, POST, Cookies, HTTP Headers (User-Agent, Referer, custom ones).
- **Fuzz More Aggressively:** Different wordlists, different extensions.
- **Think About the Technology Stack:** What vulnerabilities are common to PHP, Node.js, Python/Flask/Django, Ruby on Rails, Java/Spring?
- **Look for Out-of-Band Interactions:** DNS exfiltration, blind SSRF triggering external connections.
- **Client-Side vs. Server-Side:** Is the logic you're targeting client-side (JavaScript) or server-side?
- **Try Variations of Payloads:** Case changes, different encodings, comments to break up WAFs (/\*\*/, +, スペース).
- **Check for Race Conditions.**
- **Look for Logic Flaws:** Can you abuse the intended functionality in an unintended way?

**B. Cryptography Stuck?**

- **Is it Really Crypto?** Could it be a complex encoding or a custom algorithm, not a standard cipher?
- **Key Format/Encoding:** Is the key in hex, base64, raw bytes?
- **Endianness:** For block ciphers or multi-byte values.
- **Parameters for Modern Ciphers:** IV, nonce, tag, salt. Are they correct? Are they provided?
- **Known Plaintext Attack:** Do you have any plaintext/ciphertext pairs?
- **Frequency Analysis (again):** Even on weird character sets.
- **Small Search Space for Part of Key?** Can you brute-force a few bytes?
- **Common CTF Crypto Tropes:** Reused XOR key, RSA with small e or factorable n, weak padding.
- **Is the "Ciphertext" actually an image, audio, or other file type?**

**C. Reverse Engineering Stuck?**

- **Dynamic Analysis:** If static is confusing, run it. Observe I/O, memory changes, API calls (strace/ltrace on Linux).
- **Patch and Test:** Change a conditional jump. Does behavior change as expected?
- **Focus on Loops and Conditionals:** These often contain the core logic.
- **Decompiler Output Issues:** Try a different decompiler, or focus on the assembly for critical sections. Decompilers aren't perfect.
- **Cross-References:** Where is this function called from? Where is this string/variable used?
- **Obfuscation Type:** Is it packed (UPX?), virtualized, or just complex code?
- **Look for Anti-Debugging Tricks:** If it crashes in a debugger, that's a clue.
- **Re-implement Logic in Python:** If you understand a small part, re-write it to test your understanding.

**D. Forensics Stuck?**

- **Wrong File Type Assumption?** file might be wrong or it could be a composite file. binwalk -Me &lt;file&gt;
- **Hidden Data Streams:** NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS).
- **Different Endianness for Data Structures?**
- **Corrupted File?** Try to repair it or carve known headers/footers.
- **Timezone Issues:** Are timestamps UTC or local?
- **Steganography Layering:** Could there be stego within stego, or stego after a file is carved?
- **Memory Dump: Wrong Profile?** Volatility needs the correct OS profile. Try kdbgscan.
- **PCAP: Any Encrypted Traffic?** TLS? Can you find keys to decrypt (e.g., in memory dump, nearby files)?
- **Think about the User:** What would a typical user do on this system? Where would they store things?

**E. Binary Exploitation (Pwn) Stuck?**

- **Protections Check:** Re-run checksec. Did you account for NX, PIE, Canary, RELRO?
- **Offset Incorrect?** Double-check buffer overflow offsets.
- **Bad Characters in Shellcode/ROP Chain?** Null bytes, newlines, etc.
- **Address Issues (PIE/ASLR):** Are you using leaked addresses correctly? Is the leak reliable?
- **Gadget Issues:** Does the ROP gadget do what you think? Does it corrupt registers?
- **Alignment Issues:** Stack alignment for system() or other functions (especially on x64, needs 16-byte alignment before call).
- **Environment Differences:** Local exploit works, but remote fails? (Different libc, paths, etc.). Try to get a shell and explore the remote environment.
- **Input/Output Issues:** stdin/stdout buffering? Use p.interactive() in pwntools to debug.
- **Try a Simpler Exploit:** Can you just crash it controllably? Can you overwrite a variable instead of full EIP control?

**F. OSINT Stuck?**

- **Vary Search Terms:** Synonyms, related concepts, different languages.
- **Different Search Engines:** Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Baidu, specialized search engines (e.g., for IoT devices like Shodan).
- **Go Deeper into Search Results:** Page 2, 3, etc. Sometimes gold is buried.
- **Pivot on New Information:** Every piece of data found can be a new search query.
- **Timeframe Analysis:** Was the information posted recently or long ago? (Wayback Machine).
- **Look for Connections Between People/Entities.**
- **Consider the Source's Bias/Purpose:** Why was this information made public?
- **Think Outside the Box:** Could the info be in a non-obvious place (e.g., forum signature, game profile, Amazon review)?

**G. Miscellaneous Stuck?**

- **Is it a Known Puzzle/Format?** Google image snippets, unique strings, file signatures.
- **Brute-Force Small Parts:** If it's a sequence or a simple transformation.
- **Look for Patterns:** Repetition, sequences, common intervals.
- **Ask: "What's the simplest possible interpretation?"**
- **Ask: "What's the most obscure interpretation related to the CTF theme?"**
- **Work Backwards:** If you know the flag format, can you deduce parts of the solution?

This battle plan should provide a solid foundation for your advanced CTF endeavors. Remember that practice, adaptability, and a calm mindset are your best assets. Good luck!
