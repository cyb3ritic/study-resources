## What is a network?
A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.

### Network devices
- **switch**: 
    - have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+),
    - provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN (Local Area Network),
    - do not provide connectivity between LANs/over the internet.
    - examples: Catalyst 9200, Catalyst 3650.
- **router**:
    - have fewer network interfaces than switches,
    - are used to provide connectivity between LANs,
    - are therefore used to send data over the internet.
    - examples: ISR 100, ISR 900, ISR 4000

- **firewalls**:
    - monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules, 
    - can be placed 'inside' the network, or 'outside' the network,
    - are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include moders and advanced filtering capabilities.
    - Types:
        - Network Firewalls: Hardware devices that filter traffic between networks.
        - Host-based Firewalls: Software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.
    - examples: ASA5500-X, Firepower 2100, Windows Firewall

- **server**: A device that provides functions or services for clients.
- **client**: A devidce that access a service made available by a server.
